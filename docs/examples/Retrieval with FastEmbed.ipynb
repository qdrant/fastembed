    "1. Setup: Installing the necessary packages.\n",
    "2. Importing Libraries: Importing FastEmbed and other libraries.\n",
    "3. Data Preparation: Example data and embedding generation.\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to install the dependencies. `fastembed` to create embeddings and perform retrieval."
